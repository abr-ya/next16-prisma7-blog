## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Track records store core GPX-backed information

The system SHALL store tracks with title, unique slug, optional description, publication status, required GPX file asset reference, nullable metadata shell, owner, creation timestamp, and update timestamp.

#### Scenario: Track has required fields

- **WHEN** an authenticated admin creates a track with valid title, slug, status, and an eligible GPX file asset reference
- **THEN** the system stores the track with those values
- **AND** it records the creating user and timestamps

#### Scenario: Track slug conflicts

- **WHEN** an authenticated admin submits a track slug that is already used by another track
- **THEN** the system rejects the save with a validation error
- **AND** it preserves the existing track using that slug

#### Scenario: Track requires a GPX file asset

- **WHEN** an authenticated admin submits a track without a GPX file asset reference
- **THEN** the system rejects the save with a validation error
- **AND** it does not create or update the track

#### Scenario: Track rejects ineligible file asset

- **WHEN** an authenticated admin submits a track that references a missing, non-active, non-GPX-purpose, or already-bound file asset
- **THEN** the system rejects the save with a validation error
- **AND** it does not bind the ineligible file to the track

#### Scenario: Metadata shell remains empty in foundation slice

- **WHEN** an authenticated admin creates or updates a track in this slice
- **THEN** the system stores a nullable metadata shell
- **AND** it does not populate parsed GPX summary fields in this slice

#### Scenario: Published track is eligible for public track pages

- **WHEN** a track has `PUBLISHED` status
- **THEN** the system MAY expose its visibility-safe metadata on public track pages
- **AND** public pages SHALL NOT expose private GPX provider URLs

### Requirement: Public can browse published tracks

The system SHALL provide public track listing and detail pages that expose only published tracks.

#### Scenario: Visitor opens public track listing

- **WHEN** a visitor opens `/tracks`
- **THEN** the page lists published tracks
- **AND** it does not list draft tracks

#### Scenario: Visitor opens public track detail

- **WHEN** a visitor opens `/tracks/[slug]` for a published track
- **THEN** the page displays the track title, description when present, linked GPX filename, file size, and updated timestamp
- **AND** it does not expose parsed geometry or map UI in this slice

#### Scenario: Visitor opens missing or draft track detail

- **WHEN** a visitor opens `/tracks/[slug]` for a missing or draft track
- **THEN** the system responds as not found

### Requirement: Public track GPX downloads respect file visibility

The system SHALL expose GPX download links on public track pages only when the linked GPX file asset is active and public-download eligible.

#### Scenario: Published track has public GPX file

- **WHEN** a published track references an active GPX file asset with `PUBLIC` or `UNLISTED` visibility
- **THEN** the public track detail page shows a GPX download link through an app-owned file route
- **AND** it does not link directly to the provider URL

#### Scenario: Published track has private GPX file

- **WHEN** a published track references an active GPX file asset with `PRIVATE` visibility
- **THEN** the public track detail page shows that the GPX download is unavailable
- **AND** it does not expose a download link or provider URL

#### Scenario: Published track has inactive GPX file

- **WHEN** a published track references a GPX file asset that is not active
- **THEN** the public track detail page shows that the GPX download is unavailable
- **AND** it does not expose a download link or provider URL
