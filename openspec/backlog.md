# OpenSpec Backlog

This backlog tracks live project candidates. Completed and cancelled feature history lives in [feature-history.md](./feature-history.md).

Backlog candidates stay unnumbered until they are promoted into implementation. Promotion assigns the lowest unused `feature-XXX` number from the shared project sequence.

## Status Values

- `Candidate`: identified, but scope or timing is still flexible.
- `Ready`: scope is clear enough to promote into a numbered OpenSpec change.
- `In Progress`: implementation has started and the candidate has a `feature-XXX` number.

## Priority Values

- `P0 Now`: next or near-next work; important, unblocking, or clearly time-sensitive.
- `P1 Soon`: useful and reasonably clear, but not the immediate focus.
- `P2 Later`: valid work with known value, but sequencing is not urgent.
- `P3 Someday`: parked ideas, experiments, or large fuzzy directions.

## Numbering Rules

- `Done` numbered features live in [feature-history.md](./feature-history.md).
- Unnumbered candidates can use any free number when promoted.
- To promote a candidate, assign the lowest unused `feature-XXX` number after checking this file and [feature-history.md](./feature-history.md).
- Cancelled or deferred candidates do not reserve numbers; keep or move them as unnumbered history notes when useful.

## P3 Someday

| Status | Candidate | Area | Summary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Candidate | admin-file-category-drill-down | files/admin | Add purpose-filtered file views in admin file manager with category-specific listing, previews, stats, and management controls accessible from settings breakdown. |
